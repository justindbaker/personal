<p class="dropCap">Welcome to my blog.  My name is Justin Baker.  I am an undergraduate studying computer science at the University of Michigan.  I am interested in cybersecurity and information security and am currently doing research with the Security and Privacy Research Group, abbreviated as SPQR (I don’t know why there’s a Q in there either).  This blog will focus on the research I do and document what I learn along the way.</p>

<p>If you want a formal introduction of who I am and what I do, that can be found on my homepage.  More personally, I am an avid runner and competed for all four of my high school years.  Running is something I fell in love with when I was quite young, and it is still a huge part of my life, although I don’t compete as heavily as I used to.  Today I am a member of MRun, Michigan’s running club.  When I’m not running I still love to be outdoors: backpacking, hiking, and photography are some of my favorite things to do.</p>

<a href="" target="_blank" class="lg-blockquote">Why a blog?</a>
<p>I take notes on all of the research papers that I read, as well as what I learn at conferences and while searching around on Google.  Since I’m already taking notes on these things, I thought it could be beneficial to publish them.  Not only will it help me to find gaps in my own understanding of topics, but maybe someone out there will find this information useful in their own research.  My plan for this blog is to not only publish the progress of my research, but also what I learn from specific research papers in my “notes” articles.  By no means do these posts replace reading the original paper, but my goal is that they can give people a summary of the information in a shorter amount of time, as well as make complicated subjects more accessible to beginners.</p>
<p>I hope you find the information here useful and interesting.  I certainly am looking forward to writing these posts.</p>
